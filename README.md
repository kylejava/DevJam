## Inspiration
We wanted to build a web application that helps users understand their monthly and yearly exenditure on subscriptions like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar, HBO+, and so on. We let them select their subscriptions through our database and see it on their screen.

## What it does
Save My Wallet is a web application that allows a user to enter the subscriptions that they pay for on a monthly basis. The application then takes the prices of all these user entered subscriptions and adds the total costs of every subscription. The website then displays the monthly and yearly costs and shows the user the total cost that they are paying for every subscription service.

## How we built it
We built this website using multiple tools. For the front-end of the website we used HTML, CSS, and used the Bootstrap library for the style and design. For the back-end of the website we used Flask, and Google's firebase that allows us to authenticate users. We also implemented the Firebase's database to keep information of every user unique. The data inputted by the user now is directly stored into the database. 

## Challenges we ran into
Two of our members have never done a hackathon, so it was definitely a new environment for them because of how they had to adjust to working on a team and working on a time limit. Like usual, most hackathons are 24 to 36 hours long, but developing in a span of 7 hours was certainly difficult for us. It was also challenging to authenticate users based off their email addresses because it was the first time using Firebase.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning tools such as Flask, Firebase, HTML, and CSS in a matter of 7 hours. A lot of us were very unfamiliar with these tools or have not used them in a long time, so to be able to learn something in one day and beautifully execute it the next day was very rewarding.
